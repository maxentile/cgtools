Tools for developing coarse-graining schemes for Markov models

## Description
I've done a little tinkering in Jupyter notebooks, and I'm moving convenience functions out of those notebooks into this repository for now.

For now, this is mostly exploratory, but if I develop any solid / useful-looking methods here, I plan to contribute them to MSMBuilder and PyEMMA projects.

If you have any ideas for coarse-graining, feel free to shoot me an email or open an Issue or Pull Request.
